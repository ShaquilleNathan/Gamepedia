# 🎮 Gamepedia

**Gamepedia** is an experimental web project that provides detailed information about popular video games. Designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website simulates a gaming shop interface where users can browse games by genre, view detailed information about each title, and explore the site as if they were interacting with a real online game store.

Although some features are currently non-functional (such as game purchases and dynamic reviews), Gamepedia serves as a concept prototype for a future, more advanced version of a full-fledged game e-commerce website.

## 🌟 Features

- **Product Details Page**  
  Each game includes:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Displayed Price
  - Fictional Review Count

- **Genre Filtering on Our Shop Page**  
  Games can be filtered by genre using a navigation filter:
  - Show All (`*`)
  - Adventure (`.adv`)
  - Strategy (`.str`)
  - Action (`.act`)
  - Shooting (`.sho`)
  - Fighting (`.fig`)
  - Simulator (`.sim`)

  Filtering logic is based on the use of `data-filter` attributes and corresponding CSS classes.

- **Non-Functional Purchase Logic**  
  Game buying and reviews are static and for display purposes only.
